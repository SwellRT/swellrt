/**
 * Manages keyboard focus among a set of sibling focusables, firing focus and
 * blur events. Managers can be organized into a hierarchy, for modular UI
 * focus.
 * <p>
 * From the focusables in its domain, a focus manager keeps at most one of them
 * selected. Key events to this manager are routed to the selected focusable. As
 * this focus manager gains and loses focus, it fires focus and blur events on
 * the selected focusable.
 * <p>
 * To help explain the need for a hierarchy (rather than a flat domain of
 * focusables), and the difference between selected and focused, consider an
 * application with a windowed UI, with a main window and a chat window. In the
 * main window are multiple tabs, including an explorer tab with a tree control
 * of resources, and an editor tab for an open resource. If focus is in the chat
 * window, and some signal occurs to place application focus on a resource in
 * the tree control (e.g., a click event occurs on it), then that resource
 * demands application focus (using {@link #ensureGlobalFocus()}. This causes it
 * to become the selected resource in the domain of the tree control, the
 * explorer tab becomes the selected tab in the domain of tabs, and the main
 * window becomes the selected window in the domain of windows (stealing
 * selection and focus from the chat window). Additionally, each of those
 * objects becomes focused, which means that key events will be routed to them
 * (top down). If application focus is moved back to the chat window, the
 * explorer tab remains the selected tab in its domain, and the clicked-on
 * resource remains the selected resource in its domain. The selected window
 * transitions from the main window to the chat window.
 * <p>
 * The tree nature of focus managers is to enable modular UIs. The distinction
 * between selected and focused is so that selection can remain persistent
 * despite application focus moving around. The only constraint between
 * selection and focus is that, for the deepest focusable with application
 * focus, all its ancestors (including itself) are both focused and selected.
