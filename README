"Wave in a Box" (WIAB) project is a stand alone wave server and rich web client that serves as an Apache Wave reference implementation.
Apache Wave site: http://incubator.apache.org/wave/
This project lets developers and enterprise users run wave servers and host waves on their own hardware. And then share those waves with other wave servers.
 
Build:

This code requires Java 6.  If you are on MacOS 10.5 (Leopard) or earlier,
you'll need to install it from
http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/javaformacosx105update1.html - 
MacOS 10.5 ships with Java 5 by default.

Wave in a Box uses Ant to build. To run the tests, run:

<code>
  ant test
</code>

<code>
  ant
</code>

To build the client and server without tests (faster) run:
<code>
  ant compile-gwt dist-server
</code>


It will be created in dist/waveinabox-X.Y.jar.

You need to configure your instance before you can use it. To create a default simple configuration run:
<code>
  ant -f server-config.xml
</code>

To override default values pass them to the ant script. 
For example, to override wave_server_domain run : ant -f server-config.xml -Dwave_server_domain=example.com
Take a look at the server.config.example to learn about configuration and possible/default values.

The server can be started (on Linux/MacOS) by running
./run-server.sh
Or, you can run the server from the compiled classes with ant:
<code>
  ant run-server
</code>
The web client will be accessible at http://localhost:9898/

To learn more about Wave in a Box and Wave Federation Protocol:
1. Look at the whitepapers folder - the information is a bit old but still usable.
2. Watch the Wave Summit videos on YouTube, find the links at: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WAVE/Wave+Summit+Talks
3. Subscribe to the wave-dev mailing list, find instructions at http://incubator.apache.org/wave/mailing-lists.html

Wave Protocol communicates using Protocol Buffers 
<http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/>
Because of the difficulty of distributing binaries, we do not include the 
protocol compiler in this distribution. Therefore, to rebuild updated 
protocol buffer files, you will need to install the binary protoc 
in your environment by fetching the protobuf code from the website 
above.

Additionally, you will have to update the build-proto.properties file to
point to the unpacked source distribution of the protocol buffers release.

Then, after updating a proto file, run

<code>
  ant -f build-proto.xml compile compile_json
</code>

Note: this generates files into proto_src. If files here exist without 
write permission, you will get permission denied errors from this step.

Note also that you don't need protoc unless you want to change the proto
files.
